# Amazon-Simple-Storage-Service-Amazon-S3
In this lab, I have created a personalized, publicly accessible static website. Learned how to use a presigned URL to temporarily share objects in your bucket. Also protected my work with a bucket policy that prevents file deletion and turned on bucket versioning in case If I need to recover previous versions of files.

Lab overview and objectives
Used some of the Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) features about to create a static website.

Static websites can contain HTML pages, images, style sheets, and all files that are needed to render a website. Static websites do not use server-side scripting or a database. However, they may contain client-side scripts that run in a user's web browser. 

hosted a static website on Amazon S3 by uploading the content and making it readable by users. No servers are needed, and we can use Amazon S3 to store and retrieve any amount of data at any time from anywhere on the web.
